# product_based_iot_platform
This repository contains the code written for a Product based IoT platform which i have made using Django.
Here, the user can access their home automation products from dashboard which will only be enabled and linked with the user's personal account when they enter the unique device ID assigned to the home automation automation product.
And after successful product linking with account, user can control that device from anywhere in the world.
The frontend template is taken from colourlib and backend is developed by me using Django framework.
